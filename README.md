# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
Following Part 1 in the assignment.md file, a new PostgreSQL database called `ecommerce` was created.
Created program "read_table_column_name_and_type_function.py" to display each table column with their datatype;
input exact file_name and type (c for .csv or x for .xlsx) and the program will list the column names and datatype.
Note: make sure the file is in the same location as the tables to read for it to work.
